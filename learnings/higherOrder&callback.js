//Higher Order Functions
    // Functions that accepts other functions
    // Enhance the behaviour of other functions
    // eg runWithDegugger, setTimeout, forEach & addEventListener

//Callback functions
    // functions that are passed into higher order functions
    // eg the function that you give to runWithDebugger would be a callback function 
    // (exact same for the other functions listed above)
